    This map shows trends in unusually hot temperatures at individual weather stations that have operated consistently since 1948. 
    In this case, the term “unusually hot” refers to a daily maximum temperature that is hotter than the 95th percentile temperature during 
    the 1948–2015 period. The map shows changes in the total number of 
    days per year that were hotter than the 95th percentile. 

    Orange points show where these unusually hot days are becoming more 
    common. Blue points show where unusually hot days are becoming less common.
